# Image Generation Using GANs

This project utilizes a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate realistic handwritten digit images based on the **MNIST dataset**. The GAN model consists of a **generator** and a **discriminator** that work together to create high-quality synthetic images resembling real-world digits.

## Key Features:
- Trained on the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits.
- Built using **PyTorch**, offering flexibility and performance.
- Generates **realistic synthetic images** of handwritten digits.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open **Google Colab** and upload the notebook.
3. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
   ```python
   !pip install torch torchvision
4. Run the training script provided in the Colab notebook.
5. View the generated images in the output folder.
